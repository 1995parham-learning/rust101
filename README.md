## Introduction

Easy to understand applications with rust just for having fun :relieved:

## BPF

To write BPF code in Rust, it's easiest to use cargo-bpf (part of the redbpf suite)
which handles setting up the project and can even function as a development loader.

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu llvm
cargo install cargo-bpf --features=llvm13
```

```sh
cargo new elbpf
cargo bpf add hello_world
```

## Projects
