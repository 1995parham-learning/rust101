## Introduction

Easy to understand applications with rust just for having fun :relieved:

## BPF

To write BPF code in Rust, it's easiest to use cargo-bpf (part of the redbpf suite)
which handles setting up the project and can even function as a development loader.

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu llvm
cargo install cargo-bpf --features=llvm13
```

```sh
cargo bpf new elbpf
cargo bpf add hello
```

## Projects

### Phone Book :iphone:

Phone book application stores users and their phones as struct. It has an uncomplicated menu, and users can add, get, and remove entities.

### Word Count ðŸ”¢

This application receives a delimiter and some entries (i.e. some text files or array of strings) and after separation based on a delimiter, it will count and calculate the number of each word in the entries.

## Data in Depth

This example is based on _Rust in Action_ book and shows how data is stored.
One of its example use rust overflow panic and if you build it in release mode then you don't have it.
